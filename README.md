## This below list compiles Amina Hossein's reasoning for flagging authors as 'zionists':
- "blog posts about how israel has the right to defend itself"
- "reposted a "neutral" statement"
- "posted multiple pro israel statements"
- "allegedly posted pro-palestine messaging previously, however she favorably posted a book by SJM to her instagram story, and then blocked an instagram user after they called her out for it"
- "posted a lot of pro israel stuff"
- "posted donation link to a pro israel medical service"
- "reposted a pro israel graphic in aftermath of oct 7" x3

- "called the student encampments anti-semitic and other hot takes"
- "travels to israel frequently talks favorably about it"
- "moved to live in israel"
- "posted neutral statement but erring favorably towards israel"
- "only talks about hamas when discussing palestine"
- "husband was in IDF and lived in israel for a while. no official statement"
- "posted a pray for israel graphic in aftermath of oct 7"

- "posted a "both sides" statement in aftermath of oct 7"
- "went to pro israel demos and blocked users who disagree with her pro israel stance"
- "reposted israel flag in aftermath of oct 7"
- "had an instagram statement where she said anything against children is abhorrent but still justifying working with an israel publisher. also is weirdly into the military and married to a military man. and is also participating in the gaza book auction. but also believes israel has the right to exist idk my head hurts!!"
